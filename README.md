# My Portfolio
Hello, my name is Verkeia Foley. Nice to meet you.

## Coding Background
My professional journey began in 2016 at Rocket Mortgage, where I excelled in mortgage operations until 2021. However, my true passion lay in software engineering, prompting me to embark on a career transition. Recognizing the competitiveness of the field, I proactively enrolled in a coding workshop at Grand Circus in 2020, where I was introduced to HTML and CSS. The experience was so fulfilling that I eagerly joined an after-hours coding bootcamp, honing my skills in SQL and C#.

My thirst for knowledge and growth led me to explore further, and I took courses on Git and GitHub on the Journey site. It was during this time that I knew programming was the path I wanted to pursue as a career. Determined to make my dream a reality, I applied for and was accepted into the esteemed DevBuild program offered by the Rock Family of Companies.

Throughout the intensive bootcamp, I focused on mastering C# and Angular, and upon completion, I found myself on a front-end development team. Currently, I thrive in an enterprise setting, actively contributing to the creation of company websites and collaborating with a dynamic team.

Driven by a commitment to personal and professional growth, I continued to expand my expertise, taking an Angular JS course at Master Polyglots to further enrich my knowledge.

As a developer, my brand centers around crafting user-friendly web applications with a strong emphasis on helping others. My ambition knows no bounds, and I am eager to gain more experience in software development on an enterprise level, setting my sights on achieving remarkable success in the industry.
